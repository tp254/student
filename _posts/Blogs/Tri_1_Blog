# Tri 1 Retrospective

This post collects reflections, lessons, and next steps from the first trimester. It covers personal growth, three sprint highlights, N@tM feedback, project roadmap, learning goals, analytics and MCQ review, and one cool thing I want to share.

## 1) Where I am vs the beginning of the year
- Beginning of the year: basic confidence with syntax, tentative about architecture and testing.
- Now: clearer mental models for problem solving, more comfortable reading and modifying other people's code, and better at writing small, testable functions.
- Concrete improvement: I write fewer "trial-and-error" runs in the REPL and more deliberate small tests.

## 2) Key things from three sprints
- Tools
  - Git workflows became routine (feature branches, PRs).
  - Learned to use VS Code features: integrated terminal, test runner, and debugging.
  - Basic automation: linting and simple scripts to run test suites.

- Fundamentals of JavaScript / Python
  - Reinforced core concepts: scope, closures (JS), first-class functions, and list/dict comprehensions (Python).
  - Practice with conditionals and control flow improved the structure of my solutions.
  - Unit testing basics: writing assertions, test setup/teardown patterns.

- West Coast Travel / Digital Famine (project sprint)
  - Product thinking: turning a dataset / theme into user stories and minimal viable features.
  - Data handling: simple ingestion and display; learned trade-offs between UX polish and shipping features.
  - Collaboration: splitting tasks, syncing on APIs and data formats.

## 3) N@tM — how it went
- Outcome: Project demonstrated technical depth and clear explanations.
- Feedback I liked:
  - Comments highlighting the clarity of my technical language.
  - Praise about the depth of the project and how it connected tools and concepts.
- Takeaway: Stronger emphasis on communicating design decisions paid off.

## 4) Next on the project (given time)
- Short-term (next sprint)
  - Add automated tests for core modules (unit + a small integration test).
  - Improve README and architecture diagram.
  - Fix one UX friction reported in user testing.

- Medium-term
  - Add simple analytics dashboard to track feature usage.
  - Implement a small backend endpoint to serve aggregated data.

## 5) What I want to learn next in CompSci
- Algorithms & data structures: practice common patterns and complexity trade-offs.
- Software engineering: design patterns, system design basics, and testing strategies.
- DevOps basics: CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and simple deployments.

## 6) Analytics review (summary)
- Metrics to track:
  - Pageviews and unique visitors for the project pages.
  - Feature usage (which pages or endpoints are used most).
  - Test coverage for critical modules.
- Current status (if available): prioritize adding event logging to capture these metrics; even simple CSV logs are useful to start.

## 7) MCQ review — score, corrections, and approach
- Score: log your raw score and list topics missed.
- Correction approach:
  - For each missed question, write a 1–2 sentence explanation of the correct concept.
  - Re-create a short test problem that targets the same misunderstanding.
- Strategy going forward: timed practice, review flashcards for weak topics, and deliberately explain answers aloud.

## 8) Something cool to share
- Demo idea: a tiny interactive visualization showing how a conditional tree evaluates a small program (step-by-step highlight of branches taken).
- Benefit: helps teammates and future readers see control flow concretely.

## Closing
Congrats on a great N@tM. Many people commented to me about the depth of your project, and they were impressed with your technical language. Keep iterating: write tests, add small analytics, and continue practicing fundamentals.

If you want, I can:
- Turn this into a polished Jekyll post with images and metadata.
- Add a small analytics template (Netlify Analytics / Plausible / simple CSV logger).
- Generate a checklist of next-sprint tasks and example unit tests.
