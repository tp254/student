## Main Points

1. **No single path into CS**  
   - Everyone came from different places - some switched majors, others started late
   - Many found CS through random thinsg they enjoyed
   - You don't need to have it figured out early

2. **High school actually matters**  
   - AP classes and CS courses aren't just a "grade"
   - They help with time management, communication, and problem-solving

3. **Break things down**  
   - Use kanban boards, timelines, small steps
   - Don't try to solve everything at once

4. **Project ideas = real problems**  
   - Notice what issues there are in daily life
   - Talk to people
   - Build something small, test it, improve it

5. **Communication > just coding**  
   - Explaining your code, writing comments, documenting items
   - All just as important as writing the actual code

6. **College essays don't need to be technical**  
   - Most panelists wrote about impact, curiosity, or community
   - Not just "here's all the code I wrote"
   - Imporant to also build what lessons you  learnt and what you want to carry forward

7. **PBL is really valuable**  
   - Project-based learning teaches you how things actually work in the real world
   - Its very important to "learn by doing" rather than listening to a teacher give a presentation.

8. **Take advantage of opportunities**  
   - Network, talk to people in industry
   - Try new things early
   - Don't be afraid to put yourself out there and go after every oppurtunity that you see available.

## Q&A Highlights

### Why CS?
- Neha: wanted law school, changed mind after reflecting
- Aadit: Liked building Legos as a kid, tranlated to FTC/robotics and continued passion. 
- Michael: film background, found similar creative satisfaction in CS
- Tanisha: Liked Del Norte's curriculum and wanted to further pursue her passion. 

### What helped in high school?
- AP classes for thinking/writing
- CyberPatriot for getting comfortable with computers
- Internships for learning to explain tech to non-tech people
- CSSE/CSP/CSA courses

### Breaking down problems?
Everyone uses agile methods - iteration, boards, APIs. Michael designs APIs first. Tanisha breaks ML into data + schema + timeline.

### Where do ideas come from?
- Watch how people use things
- Internship projects
- Customer interviews and MVPs
- Everyday life problems

### College essay topics?
Impact, community, curiosity, resilience. Personal growth over technical details.

### Skills that transferred?
- Time management
- Handling stress
- Public speaking
- Taking initiative
- Learning on your own (Stack Overflow, docs, etc.)

### Code communication?
- Good commit messages
- Comments that actually help
- Talk through code with teammates
- Documentation so knowledge isn't stuck in one person's head
- Explain impact, not just technical details

## Advice

**Aadit:** Try your best and have fun. If you commit, you can do it.

**Michael:** Find PBL courses. Try things outside your major.

**Tanisha:** Use networking events. Talk to people in industry.

**Mortenson:** Work hard in class so you have time for life outside class.

## My Takeaways

CS isn't about being naturally good at programming. It's more about:
- Being curious
- Trying things and fixing them
- Communicating well
- Solving real problems
- Having balance

There are many ways to do this for me:
- Find what you like
- Build skills slowly
- Stay open to new oppurtunties
- Pursue your passions and interests while also exploring new ones.
