        <h1>Tri 1 Retrospective</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> Reflecting on my learnings, projects, and takeaways from Trimester 1 CSP<br>
        Author: Tanay Paranjpe</p>

        <p>This post collects reflections, lessons, and next steps from the first trimester. It covers personal growth, three sprint highlights, N@tM feedback, project roadmap, learning goals, analytics and MCQ review, and some cool things to share.</p>

        <h2>1) Where I Am Now vs. the Beginning of the Year</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>At the beginning of the year:</strong><br>
            I came in with some basic experience in syntax, but I didn't have a strong understanding of tools, agile methodologies, or general coding practices. I often ran commands without fully understanding what they did, and I struggled to troubleshoot issues when things broke.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Now:</strong><br>
            I've grown much more confident using the tools we work with every day. I take the time to understand how they function and how to fix problems when they appear (for example, when <code>make</code> doesn't run properly on a new repo).<br>
            I'm more comfortable reading and modifying other people's code and have learned how to apply agile methods effectively to improve team efficiency and collaboration.</li>
            
            <li><strong>AI usage improvements:</strong><br>
            A big personal development this trimester was learning how to use AI tools effectively. I learned how to craft efficient prompts, integrate AI-generated ideas into my projects, and understand both the capabilities and limitations of these models. Instead of relying on AI to do the work, I use it as a guide to accelerate problem-solving and learning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tools</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Git workflows have become more natural for me, collaborating on multi-team projects, and commit etiquette are now part of my normal routine.</li>
            <li>I became comfortable with VS Code features like the integrated terminal and file organization.</li>
            <li>I learned how to push commits and deploy projects directly through GitHub.</li>
            <li>Scrum practices (daily class discussions, sprint reviews, retrospectives) helped me stay organized and communicate better with my team.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fundamentals of JavaScript & Python</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforced key programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and control flow, which improved my ability to structure and organize code.</li>
            <li>Frequent practice through homework and sprint tasks helped me strengthen my understanding of both languages.</li>
            <li>These fundamentals are not just helpful for the AP exam, they're also essential for real-world programming and logical thinking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Topics/Learnings</h3>
        
        <p><strong>Variables & Assignments:</strong> Was important in many instances during the West Coast project and coding overall. The ability to assign and reassign variables through iterations or mathematical expressions is crucial.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Conditionals:</strong> Another crucial part of programming. I used it quite often when making interactive features on my project where the user's actions would determine the condition for the next instance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Strings:</strong> They were a pretty simple topic to teach about, but it was still important when text needs to be assigned in variables or when I had to print to the blog. String manipulation helped me format data properly and create clean outputs for users to read.</p>

        <h2>2) Issues & Solutions</h2>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Issue</th>
                    <th>How I Fixed/Solved It</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Didn't understand tools and ran commands blindly</td>
                    <td>Started taking time to research what each command does and how to troubleshoot when things break</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Struggled with Git workflows and collaboration</td>
                    <td>Practiced commit etiquette, learned proper PR creation, and got comfortable with multi-team projects</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Didn't know how to use AI effectively</td>
                    <td>Learned to craft efficient prompts and use AI as a guide rather than relying on it to do the work</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Weak understanding of agile methodologies</td>
                    <td>Applied Scrum practices daily through class discussions, sprint reviews, and retrospectives</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Disorganized data integration in sports module</td>
                    <td>Working on improving functionality and integration of sports statistics to create better flow through site features</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Inconsistent UI themes across project</td>
                    <td>Planning to create unified UI experience and design language using better AI prompting for consistency</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>3) Sprint Highlights - West Coast Travel </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Learned how to apply my skills working with teammates, but also across the classroom. Utilizing Scrum methodology to create PRs and to integrate projects across sub-teams in the class.</li>
            <li><strong>Data handling:</strong> simple ingestion and display; learned trade-offs between UX polish and shipping features.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> splitting tasks, syncing on APIs and data formats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4) Night at The Mueseum — How It Went</h2>
        <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> A great introduction for me on presenting the projects I had worked on, demonstrating my technical ability, and connecting with CSA students to gather feedback and advice.</p>
        
        <h3>Feedback I Liked:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Comments highlighting the application and organization of our entire project.</li>
            <li>How the quiz integration updated throughout all sub-modules, and specifically how the sports module was able to use real life statistics from stadiums across the journey to teach API basics.</li>
            <li>"I was also able to provide feedback to some other CSP groups, such as the West coast backend group where they had a nice interactive activity to learn about API building" - CSA Student Mihir B.</li>
        </ul>
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/N@TM.png" alt="" width="300px">
  <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/N@TM_2.png" alt="" width="400px">

        <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Presenting to an audience helped me realize the importance of clear communication and how to explain technical concepts in accessible ways.</p>

        <h2>5) Next on the Project)</h2>
        <h3>Short/Medium Term (Next Sprint)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unified UI experience and design language. Currently there are many different themes and styles, and it can make it a little hard to properly navigate the website.</li>
            <li>Improve functionality and integration of sports statistics and stadium data. Currently the data integration is disorganized and doesn't tie into the theme as well as it should to create a balanced and logical flow through the site's features.</li>
            <li>Find a more optimal balance of AI-developed code by creating better prompt language to create the more unified UI experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6) What I Want to Learn Next in CompSci</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How to best utilize AI and generative models to the best of my ability:</strong> I want to be able to properly "vibe code" and understand how to most efficiently utilize my resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Better organizational practices in my team groups:</strong> I want to utilize GitHub issues more fully and keep an updated Kanban board to keep clean thinking.</li>
            <li><strong>Further my understanding of CS and its application:</strong> I want to learn how I can deepen my knowledge of computer science and its application in nearly everything we use today.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7) Analytics Review (Summary)</h2>
        <h3>Role in Our Team:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked on submodule 1 and submodule 3 in the Sports West Coast module.</li>
            <li>Had the job of ideating how we wanted to lay out all of our information, and worked with our Scrum master directly to lay out how we would teach our topic of APIs integrated into the trip experience.</li>
            <li>Started multiple repos and maintained consistent commit history on GitHub.</li>
            <li>Participated in testing and feedback sessions to improve our features.</li>

          
        </ul>
 

        <h2>8) MCQ Review — Score, Corrections, and Approach</h2>
        <p><strong>Score:</strong> 52/66 on the 2018 MCQ</p>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q22: Procedure to determine the weather</strong><br>
            My Choice: C | Correct Choice: B<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> I had thought that total < 0.5 * counter would be the correct option because it would be selecting only the 50 percent of options that were greater than the average temperature, but this option modeled that incorrectly. The total must be greater than half of the counter value because that is the only way for the Boolean expression to output a true statement.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q25: Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS</strong><br>
            My Choice: A | Correct Choice: B<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> In byte pair encoding, the only terms that could be replaced are "AN" twice. Therefore it would be possible to represent this through byte pair encoding by replacing those terms with a filler. However in the string "LEVEL_UP" this is not possible because there is no pair of characters that appears twice in that string.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q29: Diagram with three logic gates</strong><br>
            My Choice: B | Correct Choice: A<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> In the option that I chose, having two true inputs into the AND will return a true. Two false inputs in the OR gate will return a false. These two into the OR gate return a true, which is incorrect as the question wants an output of false. Therefore, the AND gate needs opposing booleans, and the OR gate needs two false inputs in order to return a false from the second OR gate.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q30: Video-streaming service by genre</strong><br>
            My Choice: A | Correct Choice: D<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> In the option that I chose, I assumed that the function Analysis would only run once, however it is called 4 times in addition to the first call made, therefore it will take approximately 5 hours for the whole task to be completed.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q42: Increasing bit representation for internet protocol</strong><br>
            My Choice: C | Correct Choice: D<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> The correct option here is D because when using 32-bit addressing, there would be 2^32 possible addresses that could be used. Because there is one set of 2^32 addressing already used and we require 2^128, 2^96 times as many addresses are available.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q44: Using a 4 bit representation for integers</strong><br>
            My Choice: A | Correct Choice: B<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> My choice 4+8 is incorrect because in 4 bit representations, the largest value could be 16. Therefore, only option 2 is correct because 17>16.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q50: Searching list target</strong><br>
            My Choice: C | Correct Choice: B<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> My choice C is incorrect because it doesn't use a binary search. That means that it would only look if each statement was true or false, but in this case it searches through each element sequentially. Therefore, choice B is correct.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q55: Results of the KeepPlaying procedure</strong><br>
            My Choice: A | Correct Choice: D<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> My choice was incorrect because this program can never return true because the AND gate means that it is not possible for the variable response to be both "y" and "yes" at the exact same time. Because of this, the procedure will always return false no matter what we input into the starting conditions.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q57: Generate Happy from Harp and Puppy</strong><br>
            My Choice: A | Correct Choice: B<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> Choice B is correct here because concat "Harp", 1, 2 gives only "HA" and substring of "Puppy", 3, 3 return the last three letters of puppy giving HA + PPY, giving us HAPPY.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q58: Defining Internet enabled crowdsourcing</strong><br>
            My Choice: D | Correct Choice: A<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> My answer choice included all of the provided options, including that the Internet can distribute solutions to users to solve all computational problems in a reasonable amount of time. However, this is incorrect because there are some problems that cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time, requiring more efficient or more complex processes, so this option choice is not included in the answer, giving A, only I and II.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q60: Managing complexity with abstraction</strong><br>
            My Choice: B, C | Correct Choice: A, D<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> The use of shorter variables would not help make the program less complex, and replacing lines of documentation into a single line would fail to do the same thing. However, using repeated code with a procedure would allow a function to be called more efficiently, and so would replacing string variable names to make a list of strings named "names". Therefore option B and C are incorrect, and A and D would be correct.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q63: Use of isPrime procedure</strong><br>
            My Choice: A, C | Correct Choice: B, D<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> If the count is set to 0, then it won't give an accurate number of prime numbers in the list. If count is outside the IF statement, it will increase for all entries in the list instead of just the prime entries.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q65: Correcting errors in procedure Multiply</strong><br>
            My Choice: A, D | Correct Choice: B, C<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> If y is negative, then the condition count equals y will never be met since count begins at 0 and repeatedly increases. Therefore, it is the best way to correctly multiply x and y.
        </div>

        <div class="mcq-item">
            <strong>Q66: Test cases for procedure Smallest</strong><br>
            My Choice: B, D | Correct Choice: A, C<br>
            <strong>Approach:</strong> The procedure returns the first number it encounters that is less than the first number in the list. For the list, 30, 40, 20, 10, the procedure returns 20, which is not the least value in the list. So, it makes sense that both option A and C would not return the intended value.
        </div>

        <h2>9) Something Cool to Share</h2>
        <p>I went into this class with an appreciation for CS and programming, but not a direct passion. I have been interested in computer science and semiconductor design from my parents, but this class really honed in on not only just how to program, but using industry-level collaborative techniques. I found that the most enjoyable part, there is no other class or course you can take to learn these things other than actually having the job of a software developer or data analyst, so this class has been very important for my career aspirations. In all, it has been a great experience, and I look forward to the upcoming trimester as well!</p>
