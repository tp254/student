# Girls in CS Panel - Oct 3, 2024

College students Michael Hayes, Tanisha Patel, Aadit Mathur, and Neha shared their experiences with CS.

## Main Points

**No single path into CS**  
Everyone came from different places - some switched majors, others started late. Many found CS through random things they enjoyed. You don't need to have it figured out early.

**High school actually matters**  
AP classes and CS courses aren't just for your transcript. They help with time management, communication, and problem-solving.

**Break things down**  
Use kanban boards, timelines, small steps. Don't try to solve everything at once.

**Project ideas = real problems**  
Notice what's annoying in daily life. Talk to people. Build something small, test it, improve it.

**Communication > just coding**  
Explaining your code, writing comments, documenting stuff - all just as important as writing the actual code.

**College essays don't need to be technical**  
Most panelists wrote about impact, curiosity, or community. Not just "here's all the code I wrote."

**PBL is really valuable**  
Project-based learning teaches you how things actually work in the real world. Important to also build what lessons you learnt and what you want to carry forward.

## Q&A Highlights

### Why CS?
- Neha: wanted law school, changed mind after reflecting
- Aadit: liked building Legos as a kid, translated to FTC/robotics and continued passion. 
- Michael: film background, found similar creative satisfaction in CS
- Tanisha: liked Del Norte's curriculum

### What helped in high school?
- AP classes for thinking/writing
- CyberPatriot for getting comfortable with computers
- Internships for learning to explain tech to non-tech people
- CSSE/CSP/CSA courses

### Breaking down problems?
Everyone uses agile stuff - iteration, boards, APIs. Michael designs APIs first. Tanisha breaks ML into data + schema + timeline.

### Where do ideas come from?
- Watch how people use things
- Internship projects
- Customer interviews and MVPs
- Everyday life problems

### College essay topics?
Impact, community, curiosity, resilience. Personal growth over technical details.

### Skills that transferred?
- Time management
- Handling stress
- Public speaking
- Taking initiative
- Learning on your own (Stack Overflow, docs, etc.)

### Code communication?
- Good commit messages
- Comments that actually help
- Talk through code with teammates
- Documentation so knowledge isn't stuck in one person's head
- Explain impact, not just technical details

## Advice

**Aadit:** Try your best and have fun. If you commit, you can do it.

**Michael:** Find PBL courses. Try stuff outside your major.

**Tanisha:** Use networking events. Talk to people in industry.

**Mortenson:** Work hard in class so you have time for life outside class.

## My Takeaways

CS isn't about being naturally good at programming. It's more about:
- Being curious
- Trying things and fixing them
- Communicating well
- Solving real problems
- Having balance

There's no right way to do this. Find what you like, build skills slowly, stay open to new stuff. Small steps add up. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there and go after every opportunity that you see available. It's very important to "learn by doing" rather than listening to a teacher give a presentation.
