# Tri 1 Retrospective

This post collects reflections, lessons, and next steps from the first trimester. It covers personal growth, three sprint highlights, N@tM feedback, project roadmap, learning goals, analytics and MCQ review, and some cool things to share. 

-

## 1) Where I Am Now vs. the Beginning of the Year

- **At the beginning of the year:**  
  I came in with some basic experience in syntax, but I didn’t have a strong understanding of tools, agile methodologies, or general coding practices. I often ran commands without fully understanding what they did, and I struggled to troubleshoot issues when things broke.  

- **Now:**  
  I’ve grown much more confident using the tools we work with every day. I take the time to understand how they function and how to fix problems when they appear (for example, when `make` doesn’t run properly on a new repo).  
  I’m more comfortable reading and modifying other people’s code and have learned how to apply agile methods effectively to improve team efficiency and collaboration.

- **AI usage improvements:**  
  A big personal development this trimester was learning how to use AI tools effectively. I learned how to craft efficient prompts, integrate AI-generated ideas into my projects, and understand both the capabilities and limitations of these models. Instead of relying on AI to do the work, I use it as a guide to accelerate problem-solving and learning.


### Tools
- Git workflows have become more natural for me, collaborating on multi-team projects, and commit etiquette are now part of my normal routine.  
- I became comfortable with VS Code features like the integrated terminal and file organization. 
- I learned how to push commits and deploy projects directly through GitHub.  
- Scrum practices (daily class discussions, sprint reviews, retrospectives) helped me stay organized and communicate better with my team.


### Fundamentals of JavaScript & Python
- Reinforced key programming concepts like conditionals, loops, and control flow, which improved my ability to structure and organize code.  
- Frequent practice through homework and sprint tasks helped me strengthen my understanding of both languages.  
- These fundamentals are not just helpful for the AP exam, they’re also essential for real-world programming and logical thinking.

### Key Topic/Learnings

3.1 Variables & Assignments	3.2 Data Abstraction	3.3 Mathematical Expressions	3.4 Strings	3.5 Boolean Expressions	3.6 Conditionals	3.7 Nested Conditionals	3.8 Iteration	3.9 Developing Algorithms	3.10 Lists	3.12 Calling Procedures	3.13 Developing Procedures	3.15 Random Values	3.17 Algorithmic Efficiency


- West Coast Travel / Digital Famine (project sprint)
  - Learnt how to appluy my skilsl working with team mates, but also acorss teh clasroom. Utlizing scrum methogy to creates PRs and to integrate projects across sub teams in the class. 
  - Data handling: simple ingestion and display; learned trade-offs between UX polish and shipping features.
  - Collaboration: splitting tasks, syncing on APIs and data formats.

## 3) N@tM — how it went
- Outcome: A great introduction for me on presneting the proejcts I had worked on, demosnsating my tehcicnal ability, and connecting with CSA stuydnt to gather feedback and advice.
- Feedback I liked:
  - Comments highlighting teh application and ornization of our entire project. 
  - How teh quiz inetrgation updated throughout all sub modules, and spfically how the sports module was able to use real life statiitcis from staudidusm across teh jounrey to teach API basics. 
  - "-I was also able to provide feedback to some other CSP groups, such as the West coast backend group where they had a nice interactive activity to learn about API building" - CSA Student Mihir B.
- Takeaway: add here

## 4) Next on the project (given time)
- Short/Mediuum Term (next sprint)
  - Unfied UI experince and deisgn launages. Currently tehre ar emany differnt theems and styles, and it can make it a little hard to properly navigate teh web site
  - Improve funcationity and intrgation of sports statitics and stadium data. Currently the data intrgation is disorginzed and doens't tie into teh theme as well as it shoudl to create. balencced and logical flow through the sites features. 
  - Find a more optimal balence of AI devolped code by creating betting prompt langugae to create the more unfied UI expeierince. 


## 5) What I want to learn next in CompSci
- Algorithms & data structures: practice common patterns and complexity trade-offs.
- Software engineering: design patterns, system design basics, and testing strategies.
- DevOps basics: CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and simple deployments.

## 6) Analytics review (summary)
- Metrics to track:
  - Pageviews and unique visitors for the project pages.
  - Feature usage (which pages or endpoints are used most).
  - Test coverage for critical modules.
- Current status (if available): prioritize adding event logging to capture these metrics; even simple CSV logs are useful to start.

## 7) MCQ review — score, corrections, and approach
- Score: log your raw score and list topics missed.
- Correction approach:
  - For each missed question, write a 1–2 sentence explanation of the correct concept.
  - Re-create a short test problem that targets the same misunderstanding.
- Strategy going forward: timed practice, review flashcards for weak topics, and deliberately explain answers aloud.

Q22 Procedure to determine the weather
My Choice: C
Correct Choice: B
Approach: I had throught that total < .5 * counter woudl be the correct option ebcasue it woudl be slecting only the 50 percent of options that were greater than the avergy temrpatire, bu ttis option mdodeld that incorrecly. The total must be greater than half of the counter value because that is teh only way for the Boolean expression to output a true statement.

Q25 Shortening strings by replacing TH and IS
My Choice: A
Correct Choice: B
Approach: In byte pair encoding, the only terms that coul be repaslce are "AN" twice. Therefore it wodl be possibel to repsdsent this through byte pair encoding by repolacning thso eterms with a fillers. Howver in the string "LEVEL_UP" this is no possibel becasue ther is no pair of charters that appears twice in that string. 

Q29 Diagram with three logic gates
My Choice: B
Correct Choice: A
Approach: In teh option that I chose, having two true inputs into teh AND will return a true. Two false inputs in the or gate will reiture a false. These two intop the OR gate returen a true, which is incrrect as teh quetsion wants an output of false, Therefore, the AND gate needs opposing booleans, and the OR gate needs two false inputs in order to reture a flase from the secodn OR gate. 

Q30 Video-streaming service by genre
My Choice: A
Correct Choice: D
Approach: In the option that I chose, IO assumed that the function Alaysis woudl only run once, however it is called 4 times in addition to teh first call made, tehre fore it will tak eapproctimnly 5 hours for the whoel task to be complted. 

Q42 Increasing bit representation for internet protocol
My Choice: C
Correct Choice: D
Approach: The correct option here is D becasue when using 32-bit adressing, there woudl be 2^32 possible adresses that coudl be used. Becasue tehre is one set of 2^32 adressing already used and we rquire 2^128, 2^96 times as many afresses are avaible. 

Q44 Using a 4 bit representation for integers
My Choice: A
Correct Choice: B
Approach: The correct option here is D becasue when using 32-bit adressing, there woudl be 2^32 possible adresses that coudl be used. Becasue tehre is one set of 2^32 adressing already used and we rquire 2^128, 2^96 times as many afresses are avaible. 

## 8) Something cool to share
- Demo idea: a tiny interactive visualization showing how a conditional tree evaluates a small program (step-by-step highlight of branches taken).
- Benefit: helps teammates and future readers see control flow concretely.

## Closing
Congrats on a great N@tM. Many people commented to me about the depth of your project, and they were impressed with your technical language. Keep iterating: write tests, add small analytics, and continue practicing fundamentals.

If you want, I can:
- Turn this into a polished Jekyll post with images and metadata.
- Add a small analytics template (Netlify Analytics / Plausible / simple CSV logger).
- Generate a checklist of next-sprint tasks and example unit tests.
