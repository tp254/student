# Tri 1 Retrospective

This post collects reflections, lessons, and next steps from the first trimester. It covers personal growth, three sprint highlights, N@tM feedback, project roadmap, learning goals, analytics and MCQ review, and some cool things to share. 

## 1) Where I am now vs the beginning of the year
- Begining of the year: I had some basic experince in syntax, but didn't have expereince or proper understadning of tools, agile methogies, or genral pratcies to allow me to utlize the very basic syntix epxicne I had.
-Early on, stuggels to understand what commands I was running, what they meant, and the peoper method to trouble shoot when they did not work properly. 
Now: Much more conformatbel utlizing tools we used, and spent time to understand how they worked and how to trouble shot issues as they appear. (e.g. make doesn't properly run on new repo)
- more comfortable reading and modifying other people's code, and better at utlizing agile methogies to increase teamwide effeicny. 
-AI Usage impromenst:
-Something I have deviklped trhoughout this year is my ability to best utlize AI models to help guide the prodictio nof my projets. I learnt how to create effent propmts and undertadn teh limits and cpaiabilites in ingrtaeting input into my own code. 

## 2) Key things from three sprints
- Tools
  - Git workflows became routine (feature branches, PRs).
  - Learned to use VS Code features: integrated terminal,debugging, and scrum pratcies.
  - Learnt how to push basic commits adn open depolyed sites diretcly through Github.

- Fundamentals of JavaScript / Python
  - Reinforced core concepts of basic coding fundmentals, useful to me for both the AP exam but mroe importantly skills that are neccary in all forms of programming. 
  - Practice with conditionals and control flow improved the structure of my solutions.
  - frequent pratcie/homework allowed me to reinformce my leanring and apply my knowge to new prohjjects.  

- West Coast Travel / Digital Famine (project sprint)
  - Product thinking: turning a dataset / theme into user stories and minimal viable features.
  - Data handling: simple ingestion and display; learned trade-offs between UX polish and shipping features.
  - Collaboration: splitting tasks, syncing on APIs and data formats.

## 3) N@tM — how it went
- Outcome: Project demonstrated technical depth and clear explanations.
- Feedback I liked:
  - Comments highlighting the clarity of my technical language.
  - Praise about the depth of the project and how it connected tools and concepts.
- Takeaway: Stronger emphasis on communicating design decisions paid off.

## 4) Next on the project (given time)
- Short-term (next sprint)
  - Add automated tests for core modules (unit + a small integration test).
  - Improve README and architecture diagram.
  - Fix one UX friction reported in user testing.

- Medium-term
  - Add simple analytics dashboard to track feature usage.
  - Implement a small backend endpoint to serve aggregated data.

## 5) What I want to learn next in CompSci
- Algorithms & data structures: practice common patterns and complexity trade-offs.
- Software engineering: design patterns, system design basics, and testing strategies.
- DevOps basics: CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and simple deployments.

## 6) Analytics review (summary)
- Metrics to track:
  - Pageviews and unique visitors for the project pages.
  - Feature usage (which pages or endpoints are used most).
  - Test coverage for critical modules.
- Current status (if available): prioritize adding event logging to capture these metrics; even simple CSV logs are useful to start.

## 7) MCQ review — score, corrections, and approach
- Score: log your raw score and list topics missed.
- Correction approach:
  - For each missed question, write a 1–2 sentence explanation of the correct concept.
  - Re-create a short test problem that targets the same misunderstanding.
- Strategy going forward: timed practice, review flashcards for weak topics, and deliberately explain answers aloud.

## 8) Something cool to share
- Demo idea: a tiny interactive visualization showing how a conditional tree evaluates a small program (step-by-step highlight of branches taken).
- Benefit: helps teammates and future readers see control flow concretely.

## Closing
Congrats on a great N@tM. Many people commented to me about the depth of your project, and they were impressed with your technical language. Keep iterating: write tests, add small analytics, and continue practicing fundamentals.

If you want, I can:
- Turn this into a polished Jekyll post with images and metadata.
- Add a small analytics template (Netlify Analytics / Plausible / simple CSV logger).
- Generate a checklist of next-sprint tasks and example unit tests.
